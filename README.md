# Hi! This is shiwyang!
**Welcome to my GitHub homepage!**

- 🎓 I'm a graduate of WHPU with a major in Software Engineering.
- 💻 My expertise lies in back-end development, with a focus on Go and Python.
- 🏢 Currently, I am working at  [Horizon Robotics](https://cn.horizon.ai/), where I contribute to projects using Go and Python.
- 📚 You can find some of the technical articles I share regularly on [shiweiyang-Yuque](https://www.yuque.com/juduibenerjiasuanyierchunzhi-7tqem) and [shiwyang-Leetcode](https://leetcode.cn/u/sh1wyang/).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm not just a developer; I'm also an electric guitar player! Check out my [performance video](https://space.bilibili.com/34094578) to see me in action.
